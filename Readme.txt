Test execution:

Normal run:

php manage.php

TODO:
Tests
Use certificate for connection (verify)
Fix bug where first list doesn't have subscriber added to it
Instead of hardcoding values in Maillist.php, use reflection to get all attributes

Notes:
I'd like to have made a collection of lists and a collection of members driven by the database.
I've just set it to 1 object of each type for now to simulate addition/manipulation of 1.
